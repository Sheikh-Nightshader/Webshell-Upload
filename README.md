Webshell Upload script in Perl and another in Python. Create a text file titled targets.txt and load them with vulnerable websites like wordpress. Also the added Python script includes custom file uploads and target lists in command line arguments. This script will attempt to upload a file once it finds a path to place it. Successful uploads are saved in success.txt Which the script will make after its uploaded.

I added some webshells to use webshell.php is a simple file uploader and web.php is a file uploader aswell as command execution webshell.
