Webshell Upload scripts Python. Bypass script This script will attempt to upload your file repeatedly using different curl commands and different file headers to bypass the upload restrictions a webapp may have in place. Standard uploader script will attempt to upload your file to a web application using standard curl command. Both scripts have been tested and worked. *Note that you need to know the upload path in order for this to work. I am working on another script for Wordpress I plan to make public. The script will instead of one url at a time will use a text document of urls for mass uploads with built in upload points for it to try. I have some betas already. In the coming days I should be releasing one for you.
 I added some webshells for you to test with and added my new Webshell with file management, Command Execution and DDoS. 
 
 *DISCLAIMER These webshells and uploaders are for educational use only and to be used to test your own web applications for vulnerabilities in Authenticated/Unauthenticated file upload exploits. Aswell as to prove that these exploits are also possible in general. I take no responsibility for the use and misuse of these tools. What you do with them falls back on you. Im only the developer and want to spread awareness.
